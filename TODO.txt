- Transfer resource to other unit to save it.
  [√] add a tranfer resource to citytile procedure when condition matched
     * agent who do transfer:
       1. coal > 0 or uranium > 0
       2. citytile has any unit
       3. fuel > city_fuel_ask + 50
       4. only to the first citytile (ignore other duplicated citytile)
     * only transfer required amout for city to last to game end
  [√] Add Replan city rescue tasks based on city fuel request.
     * cap the amount of resource required by a city and ignore too much resource.
     * Ignore (unit, city) duing replan to select other targets.
  [√] Wait for idle worker to arrive and tranfer
  [√] raise the targeted city tile weight for on citytile idle worker during the
     second round of target assignment
  [-] What if two worker want tranfer? no possible, one would be enough.
  [√] How to send (or stick) non-idle worker into resource receive position.
  [] How to limit the size of city.
    * [√] add score to save small city: save small city at all cost (made of coal or uranium)
    * [] Do not build on non-near resource tile.
- [] citytile around high level resource, will block fuel into large city outside.
  * A: Support transfer for other resource, but not use the resource to build citytile.
  * [√] B: keep one boundary open for coal and uranium cluster


# resource assignment. (resource delivery)
- If multiple worker goto citytile, e.g. 5, but 3 is enough, how to deal with that?
  - another case is, if both of the worker went to city, but city will still die, what should they do?

imagine every city is a hive, and there is a queue.
- cart will deliver the resource to the queen on city (transfer)
- worker focus on resource mining and only transfer the resource to cart
- cart will maintain all the available resource in its cargo, and use left over resource for more city building.


# [Defend Cluster]
- [√] Defend opponent unit with min threaten distance, that is if the opponent unit is
  too close to my cluster, we'll defend it to our best.
- [√] If current cluster is the nearest to enemy, defend that cell.
- [√] Keep at least two near resource tile for a coal or urnaium cluster (open=1)
- [] Use different weight for less than and equal for opponent_weight


# [Cluster Assignment]
- [√] Try weight cluster by boundary opening rate
- [] Remove initial cluster assigment condition check: city > 1
- [] Assign multiple worker to large cluster
  * [] Try split large cluster into multiple ones (limit cluster size), maybe just multiple assignment?
- explore size = 1 wood

# Resource
- [] do not save wood city tile if no enemy around.
- [] Try not build on non near resource tile (except for connection point), limit city size
- Decide upon front which city to save: (resource may not be able to save all cities)
- Should also estimate whether a large city is saveable given the resource on the map.
- Visit resource far away (need to check whether it will across citytile)
  (is it the case that user should not leave citytile when amount > 0? or maybe a fair amount?)
* Limit the number of citytile per cluster
* [minor opt]: do not move to cell has limit resource due to collection: predict cell dying

# Weight
- [] Default city tile (0.000001) weight might be too large, use 0?
- ?? Do not use decay for neighbour resource tile
- How to balance city boost and cluster weight and build_city?

# Build city
- Boost cluster explore task over city build task?
- Is it possible to tranfer and build city on the first day? any use?
- [√] Step out at at last night - 3, to build city tile on first day
- [√] boost weight for neighbour city tile building (encourage citytile cluster)
  * remove build city turn limit, so worker will goto near resource tile natually
- Build city tile on long sides (to connect, side >= 2?)
* [√] Save size 1 citytile
  * with min weight of 1 for city_survive_boost & city_crash_boost

# Build woker
* [?] Do not spawn at night in dying city.

# Tranfer
- [] Try transfer coal and uranium? why we need it? (build city faster)
- Use tranfer to save worker

# Mix
- add randomized actions order
- **Ending pose: build extra city tile with transfer

# Path Search
- Add units (enemy and mine) to cell and check blocking

# Refactor
- [√] remove unused code
- [√] extract a cluster class for query cluster related info (e.g. boundary and type)
- [] Add common function for accessing debug variable
- [] Refactor cell weights into Factors or Rules
==========================

- [√] 980277360/a0/simple_defend: t19/u3 cluster and citytile back and forth
  * Fixed by lowering the city_crash_boost with worker_total_fuel(worker)


1633780525944_vVnbliZa03gd, 849304345, a1
- [√] Not delivering resource to city, but goes to next resource tile
     t111/u17, goto (1, 8), not (7, 1)
  * This is because `city_crash_boost` & `city_survive_boost` both not kick in
  * Moving on map waste much resource.
  * [√] change condition of no_resoruce_on_map => no_colletable_resource_on_map + no_resource_to_explore()
  * [x] not target res or nrt cell during plan=0: not_resource_target_worker
  * [√] limit max long wait time: 40
- [-] t27/u_9, goes into my unit to build city.
  u_6, target (0, 0) for one turn, make room for u_9 to kick in.
- [√] t280/u13 goto nrt (10, 8), not (9, 2)
- [√] t69/u6, die at near coal cell
  * This is bug for using wrong surviving_turns for estimate_cell_night_count
- [√] t268, everyone moving toward city c_14, but t268, when c14 survive this night, everyone move away.
  * worker target a crashing city c_21 (small one) and become a non resource target woker
  * after becoming non-resource target worker, city_survive_boost will kick in and target c14 (a large city)
    * because it's second round, the limit rule are by-passed.
  * once the city can last this round, the weight get lowered, and unit go to other targets.
  > Fix city weight
- [√] t230 u_17, blocked by cluster owner
  * Test remove cluster boosting when woker already arrived (only boost for non-arrival cluster)
- [√] t22/u2 why go to city tile (9, 1) not (10, 1)
  * A BUG: the first city is not added as wood city.
  * Woker goto fuel city because of city_survive_boost



# goto city items

- Fix idle worker
[√] use 0 weight for city tile
[√] set idle worker outside of assign_worker_target
[√] use smaller fuel threshold for worker_ready_to_return
[√] use no_resource_to_explore for city survive boost
    * use arrival fuel value
[√] inc weight for last city delivery: /10 => /2.5
[√] Fix initial city tile as wood city.
[√] fine ture this threshold based on different resource.

[] test threshold build_city_bonus
[] remove value decay for neighbour cell


1633778149126_tz0O90vE2o57, 60039971, a0
- [√] why first step not going to the enemy direction?
  * t0 u1 goto (9, 1) not (10, 2)
  * because of limit enemy search distance.
  [] Later, if perf if OK, use larger distance.


1633775933684_6NyW5lZL7LqB, 216087638
- [√] 1st step is not reasonable
  * Reason: below is resource tile while above is near resource tile
  * [√] reverted the neighbour cell move_day+1 demote in get_cell_resource_values
  * [√] Use larger default weight for near resource cell (before resource tile is larger)
- [√] t4/u1, goto far away cell (8, 7), not (9, 4)
  * bug: because the distance is cut by threaten dist.
  * [√] Fixed by remove continue by threaten dist during nearest cluster searching.


# Perf opt

* Fast advance when both cell are plain cell and move at day.
* [√] collect_target_cells
* is_resource_tile_can_save_dying_worker


IDEAS:
- [] Add cooldown into near_resource_tile discount?
- support wait on days for priority search (for resource research points)? why?

- Learning
* unit cargo won't goto 100 at night
* in city tile, road level is 6 (which means, move to citytile at night is good)
* A full worker will not collect resource
